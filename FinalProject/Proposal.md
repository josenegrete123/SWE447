My final project will be to create a pong game with Codey.
It will be made with two players being able to play the game.
The ball will bounce off a pad that player1 and player2 control.
If either player misses, the other player gets a point.

Week 1:
Find reference pictures of the pong game and game rules.
Week 2:
Code simple inputs, like movement.
Week 3:
Add collision detection.
Week 4:
Program the algorithm to hit the ball back and forth.
Week 5: (Stretch Goal)
Add audio/AI.

I will use webgl and three.js
