My final project will be to create a Simon game. 
It will be made of four different colored buttons and will flash to indicate which button should be pressed. 
After the correct button is pressed, the next button to be pressed will flash. 
After a certain amount of correct presses, all the colors will flash indicating that the player has won.

Week 1:
Find reference pictures of the Simon game.
Week 2:
Complete the code to render the four different colors on screen.
Week 3:
Create the ability to interact with the colors on the screen.
Week 4:
Create the flashing of the different colors and randomly generate the sequence of colors to be pressed.
Week 5: (Stretch Goal)
Add audio to every correct press and every incorrect press.

I will use javascript, webgl, css, THREE.js, and html to create the game,
